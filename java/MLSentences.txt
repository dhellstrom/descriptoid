Mike, his high priest, was a tall, portly man with spectacles and a calm demeanor.
Lightsong turned to Mike, feeling guilty at his sudden energy.

He had a deific BioChromatic aura, a physique that any man would envy, and enough luxury for ten kings.

"What, then, do you remember of your dreams last night?"
Mike nodded, rising and shooing back the servants-though, of course, they remained in the room, hovering with their plates of food, wine, and fruit, should any of it be wanted.
"Well, then," Mike said, flipping a page over, "consider it officially remembered that you have no Petitions today.
It was just that... well, he was probably the world's only god who didn't believe in his own religion.
"As soon as she arrives, your grace."
Lightsong walked on rugs from the northern nations, passing the finest pottery from across the inner sea.
Interesting, Lightsong thought.
Lightsong groaned softly, unable to sleep any longer.
"That's it, I assume?"
I don't know where it was going."
Lightsong fell into step beside Mike, towering a good foot over the priest.
Mike paused, paling just slightly.
Lightsong chuckled.
That he remembered.
Lightsong asked.
It was good to keep the priests guessing at what would please him, or so some of the gods said.
"Indeed, your grace.
Mike shook his head.
He folded his arms and rested against the side of the doorway.
Doesn't he ever get annoyed?
He nodded as the lesser priest-who stood a distance away-recorded Lightsong's words.
"All right," he said.
Now that Offerings were done, it would be time to move on to the final-and least appealing-of his daily tasks.
Lightsong lounged back again, opening his eyes and looking up at the ceiling and its brightly colored fields.
His weakness vanished, the dizziness evaporated.
A priest scuttled forward with the red tome, and Mike started writing furiously.
Lightsong sighed.
He'd never actually been to the jungle.
He felt dizzy.
And Lightsong would live for another week.
It would give him strength enough to live for another week.
"It's all right," Lightsong said.
It seemed his duty, and for some reason it was one of the few things he took seriously.
"Your grace," Mike said.
Lightsong said.
Offerings done, dreams recorded, and petitions canceled, Lightsong was free to pursue his own activities.
Lightsong didn't have the patience for things like that, especially since all anyone really ever seemed to want from him was honesty.
Mike seemed to like this response.
Lightsong froze.
"I've decided to give you a new nickname.
Lightsong hesitated, but his weakness was coming to a head.
"And a ship was leaving without me.
Instead, he made his way out onto his patio deck and waved for a pavilion to be set up for him.
"I slept fantastically, Scoot," Lightsong said, yawning.
The servants continued their ministrations, draping him with cloth.
he asked.
he thought.
As a Returned, Lightsong didn't need to eat such things-they would not give him strength or banish his fatigue.
Nothing at all...   And still, as she met his eyes as she left, and he could see that the twinkle was gone from them.
Both robes and tome burst with color as they entered Lightsong's aura.
Mike hesitated.
He felt invigorated, revitalized, alive.
It was a vision one of his predecessors had seen, or so he was told.
Mike's pen began to scratch quickly.
They continued down the line, Lightsong giving reviews of the various paintings and poems.
He wondered if the priests knew just how much their Gods gossiped about the outside world.
Lightsong was a good head and a half taller than anyone else in the room.
"I'm sure," Mike said, nodding to one of his aids outside the room.
I need to give something back, Lightsong thought.
He almost gave this one a poor grade simply because of that.
He reached over idly, plucking some cherries off a servant's plate.
The furniture and doorways, however, were built to fit Lightsong's increased size, so it was the servants and priests who seemed out of place in the palace.
Mike asked.
"Yes," Lightsong said.
Vague impressions from his dream returned to him.
"So," Lightsong said.
He simply waved a lesser priest over, then began to flip through some pages on a clipboard.
Lightsong sensed that many of them were far more calculating in the way that they gave their reviews, intentionally adding cryptic meanings.
He couldn't use it animate objects or corpses; he was a god, not an Awakener.
For some reason, I think the ocean water was red, like the ship."
He saw little use to it.
Colors, Lightsong thought.
He had to get through them before he could get to more important activities, like taking a nap.
Why should he begrudge the people his dreams?
He was probably finding all kinds of symbolism in the memory.
"Good color," he said.
Lightsong demanded.
Lightsong leaned his head back, resting it against the wall, looking up at the white ceiling.
At least, that was what Lightsong had heard.
He gave the peasant's poem as good a review as he could, though he generally felt an impulse to be honest when he looked at Offerings.
It was an abstract work, a style that was growing more and more popular lately-particularly in paintings sent to him, since he'd given favorable reviews to others in the past.
Lightsong closed his eyes, trying to focus.
Lightsong nodded.
I shouldn't be so cynical, Lightsong thought.
The prominent hue was a deep red, almost a crimson, that Lightsong immediately knew was a red-blue mixture with a hint of black in it.
Your priests will be otherwise employed."
"Fledgling fruit," he said, giving up one of the Command phrases that would let others control the city's Lifeless.
Lightsong fell silent, turning away from the men and their scribbling pens.
"Not my favorite.
By the time they neared the end of the line, Lightsong was getting tired of looking at art, though his body-fueled by the child's Breath-continued to feel strong and exhilarated.
Lightsong turned.
Cursing himself quietly, he knelt down on one knee, taking the girl's face in his oversized hands.
I'm imagining things, he told himself.
Lightsong was a terrible god.
"You know I cannot speak of your life before your Return, Lightsong.
He was also broad of shoulders, with a muscular physique that he didn't really deserve, considering the amount of time he spent idle.
It is nothing to her, Lightsong told himself again.
Lightsong sighed, looking up at the ceiling.
At the center of the palace was a small, square room that deviated from the standard reds and golds of Lightsong's motif.
As Lightsong stepped into the room, the colors blazed to life.
He gave this last painting the time it deserved.
Lightsong waited, still thinking about Susebron and the impending wedding.
It puts me at peace, yet has a tension to it as well.
Lightsong didn't know what it was like to live without the ability to instantly recognize exact shades of color and sound.
The girl looked back toward Lightsong, obviously nervous.
"Oh, you know," Lightsong flopped back onto one of his couches, lounging and relaxing.
Was there a feast or celebration he hadn't heard about?
The servants stayed outside; only Mike joined Lightsong as he stepped up to the first painting.
His aura didn't grow stronger from Breath upon which he fed; that was another difference between a Returned and an Awakener.
"Please try to remember the dreams, your grace," Mike said in his polite, yet disapproving, way.
I wish I could visit."
He didn't prompt for more information, he simply took down Lightsong's words as they came.
His hands were nearly hidden by the deep sleeves of his gold and red robe, and he carried a thick tome.
"If we must," Lightsong said.
Lightsong stopped before the final painting.
Lightsong sighed, then rose, feeling exhausted.
"I am honored, your grace," Mike said, seating himself on a chair.
Lightsong raised an eyebrow.
Lightsong didn't remember dying.
Lightsong had always found the distinction odd.
Lightsong frowned.
His priests, however, assured him that his death had been extremely brave.
He rolled over, feeling weak as he sat up in his majestic bed.
If he looked at it right, it looked like a sea.
That would, however, kill him.
Lightsong often though that the convoluted system of Commands used to control the Lifeless was needlessly complex.
Mike pursed his lips in displeasure.
Mike regarded him with a flat stare.
Lightsong turned to Mike, feeling guilty at his sudden energy.
It's nothing, he thought.
Mike raised an eyebrow.
I think it might have been her."
He walked away, leaving Mike.
Mike opened his tome.
Mike raised an eyebrow over his bespectacled eyes.
The lesser priest scribbled down what Lightsong had said about the painting.
Even if he found divination foolish, he had no right to complain.
Makes me think of the outside.
If a new queen was going to arrive today, he wanted to get a good look at her.
Lightsong moved away from the painting.
Mike scribbled furiously-he always got excited when Lightsong remembered colors.
He was one of the younger, for he'd Returned only five years before.
Mike and the servants waited.
It traveled along Lightsong's arm-the touch was necessary-and he drew it in.
Mike gave him a flat look.
That was an effect of Lightsong's innate BioChroma: he had enough Breath to fill thousands of people.
Lightsong stepped forward, and the little girl glanced to the side, where a couple of priests stood in red and gold robes.
Lightsong had died in a way that displayed extreme bravery.
Somewhere, there was a city patron who sought a blessing from Lightsong.
remember a face, sometimes," he said softly.
There were some two dozen deities in the Court of Gods, and many were far more important-and far more politically savvy-than Lightsong.
"You aren't hearing Petitions today, your grace.
was walking by a beach," he said.
There were some of these plants in the courtyards around the Court of Gods, which was why Lightsong recognized them.
Without a new Breath each week, Lightsong would die.
"Here now," Lightsong said, trying to sound encouraging.
"Kneeling reverently in the courtyard, your grace.
Or, at least, that was what his priests told him.
Of all the people in the world, he had the least right to be difficult.
Mike didn't lead the way toward the petition hall, however.
The dots of color brightened as Lightsong approached.
"Inviting brown hair," Lightsong said.
However, being one of the four Gods to hold Lifeless commands did make him rather important at times.
It had always seemed convenient to Lightsong that he couldn't remember how he had died, just like he couldn't remember anything of his life before he had become a god.
Lecture after lecture-delivered by Mike, who had claimed that they were not lectures, for one did not lecture gods-drifted through Lightsong's head.
Visions and memories pestered his mind, and he shook his head, trying to clear away the fog of sleep.
He didn't return to his main chambers.
He could tell an ideal red from one that had been mixed with even one extra drop of white paint.
Mike asked, looking up from his book.
He couldn't give-or even loan-his deific Breath away.
Mike picked up his quill.
The phrase he'd given to Mike would only allow a person to control the Lifeless in non-combat situations, and it would expire one day after its first use.
"The ship had a red sail," Lightsong said.
Mike, his high priest, was a tall, portly man with spectacles and a calm demeanor.
Mike asked.
In a short time, he would dine on something far more... divine.
He had a deific BioChromatic aura, a physique that any man would envy, and enough luxury for ten kings.
I have you to remember things like that for me."
One duty left, he thought.
Yet, he was trailed by a fleet of servants and lesser priests who would see to his needs.
Lightsong thought.
He was remarkably fortunate.
The priests would interpret Lightsong's opinion of the painting, then give the person an augury-either for good or for ill-along with the exact words Lightsong had said.
I approve."
He knew it.
Nobody told him so, but he was wise enough to see the truth.
###breath-continued
By the time they neared the end of the line, Lightsong was getting tired of looking at art, though his body-fueled by the child's Breath-continued to feel strong and exhilarated.
###susebron
Lightsong waited, still thinking about Susebron and the impending wedding.
And above them all reigned Susebron, the God King of Hallandren.
###lifeless
"We will need a Lifeless Command in order to arrange our troops on the field outside the city to welcome the queen."
###hallandren
Few people in Hallandren would admit to having that particular disease.
Many Returned outside of Hallandren lived only eight days.
It was completely white-something very unusual in Hallandren.
Each room was hung with paintings and brightly written poems, created by Hallandren's finest artists.
There was nothing to fear from the Returned Gods of the Hallandren.
And above them all reigned Susebron, the God King of Hallandren.
###command
"Fledgling fruit," he said, giving up one of the Command phrases that would let others control the city's Lifeless.
"We will need a Lifeless Command in order to arrange our troops on the field outside the city to welcome the queen."
###unknown
"What, then, do you remember of your dreams last night?"
Mike nodded, rising and shooing back the servants-though, of course, they remained in the room, hovering with their plates of food, wine, and fruit, should any of it be wanted.
"Well, then," Mike said, flipping a page over, "consider it officially remembered that you have no Petitions today.
In the center of the room was a child.
"Shall we begin?"
It was just that... well, he was probably the world's only god who didn't believe in his own religion.
The poem wasn't a very good one, obviously composed by a peasant, who had then paid someone else to translate it to the artisan's script.
She began to cry, but she said the words, clear and distinct as she had been taught.
Susebron getting a wife.
The wall was remarkably full this day.
His palace held dozens of different chambers, decorated and furnished according to his whims.
"My life to yours.
Then, you brought me a big bottle of wine and did a dance.
It was really quite remarkable."
She'll live a full life.
"That's it, I assume?"
Lightsong fell into step beside Mike, towering a good foot over the priest.
I don't know where it was going."
"You're accommodating all of a sudden."
It was good to keep the priests guessing at what would please him, or so some of the gods said.
They became brighter, yet somehow remained dark.
Mike shook his head.
"The sand was brown, of course, and the trees green.
"Was there anything else to the dream, your grace?"
Now that Offerings were done, it would be time to move on to the final-and least appealing-of his daily tasks.
Lightsong lounged back again, opening his eyes and looking up at the ceiling and its brightly colored fields.
His weakness vanished, the dizziness evaporated.
The better a painting was, the better a reaction it tended to get from the from the gods.
It seemed his duty, and for some reason it was one of the few things he took seriously.
"Your grace," Mike said.
Knowledge of your past won't do anyone any good."
Even a lesser deity such as Lightsong merited an enormous palace.
Servants approached carrying brilliant red and gold robes.
"I've decided to give you a new nickname.
Lightsong hesitated, but his weakness was coming to a head.
Either way, the act of sending a painting to please the god would gain the patron some measure of good fortune.
"And a ship was leaving without me.
It wasn't the core Command, of course.
All they needed to subsist was one thing.
Hence the Court of the Gods, filled with its palaces, where gods could be nurtured, protected, and-most importantly-fed.
The servants continued their ministrations, draping him with cloth.
"Yes, your grace?"
Most likely, the patron hadn't painted it himself, but had instead commissioned it.
Nothing at all...   And still, as she met his eyes as she left, and he could see that the twinkle was gone from them.
Both robes and tome burst with color as they entered Lightsong's aura.
A servant scuttled forward to redo one of the clasps on his robe, which had come undone as he sat.
Without this system, I'd have died five years ago.
"They will?"
The God King would be the only of the Returned who could marry.
They continued down the line, Lightsong giving reviews of the various paintings and poems.
A person without Breath.
It was a vision one of his predecessors had seen, or so he was told.
He wondered if the priests knew just how much their Gods gossiped about the outside world.
Lightsong was a good head and a half taller than anyone else in the room.
"I'm sure," Mike said, nodding to one of his aids outside the room.
Or, was it all rhetoric?
I need to give something back, Lightsong thought.
It was actually a poem, written in the artisan's script.
They nodded encouragingly.
The furniture and doorways, however, were built to fit Lightsong's increased size, so it was the servants and priests who seemed out of place in the palace.
It was completely white-something very unusual in Hallandren.
"We will need a Lifeless Command in order to arrange our troops on the field outside the city to welcome the queen."
Standing made him just a bit dizzy.
Such offerings were made specifically for the intended God, and only he-besides a few of his priests-was allowed to see them.
Lightsong sensed that many of them were far more calculating in the way that they gave their reviews, intentionally adding cryptic meanings.
He couldn't use it animate objects or corpses; he was a god, not an Awakener.
For some reason, I think the ocean water was red, like the ship."
He saw little use to it.
As they entered his aura, each servant-skin, hair, clothing, and garments-burst with an inner color.
The priest raised an eyebrow.
One's future, it appeared, could be influenced by how much one could pay one's artist.
Her Breath flowed out, puffing in the air.
It probably had to do with bravery-perhaps the patron was planning to propose marriage, or maybe he was a merchant about to sign a risky business deal.
Why does it always have to be a child?
Lightsong leaned his head back, resting it against the wall, looking up at the white ceiling.
He gave the peasant's poem as good a review as he could, though he generally felt an impulse to be honest when he looked at Offerings.
Seems to fit you, the way you're always scooting around, poking into things and such."
It was an abstract work, a style that was growing more and more popular lately-particularly in paintings sent to him, since he'd given favorable reviews to others in the past.
Hallways were for servants, and they ran in a square around the outside of the building.
"You apologized for bothering me all the time and keeping me from my debauchery.
Regardless of my belief in the religion itself, the perks are nice.
Instead, I get to be a god.
Lightsong closed his eyes, trying to focus.
I shouldn't be so cynical, Lightsong thought.
The prominent hue was a deep red, almost a crimson, that Lightsong immediately knew was a red-blue mixture with a hint of black in it.
That was why the Iridescent Tones sent the Returned back; they acted examples, and blessings, to the people who still lived.
They passed through several more rooms of red and gold, most of which were perfectly square with doors on all four sides.
Your priests will be otherwise employed."
"Fledgling fruit," he said, giving up one of the Command phrases that would let others control the city's Lifeless.
It would be burned.
Lightsong fell silent, turning away from the men and their scribbling pens.
The priests began to chat quietly about preparations and the new queen.
By the time they neared the end of the line, Lightsong was getting tired of looking at art, though his body-fueled by the child's Breath-continued to feel strong and exhilarated.
"Shall we be on with it then, your grace?"
Yet with a donated Breath a week, they could continue on, ageless, with perfect bodies and minds.
Cursing himself quietly, he knelt down on one knee, taking the girl's face in his oversized hands.
"You know I cannot speak of your life before your Return, Lightsong.
Her brown hair lost some of its luster, her cheeks became more bland.
Her family well paid for her sacrifice.
It is nothing to her, Lightsong told himself again.
At the center of the palace was a small, square room that deviated from the standard reds and golds of Lightsong's motif.
Lightsong sighed, looking up at the ceiling.
He gave this last painting the time it deserved.
As Lightsong stepped into the room, the colors blazed to life.
Most people say they can't even notice that their Breath is gone.
It puts me at peace, yet has a tension to it as well.
The girl looked back toward Lightsong, obviously nervous.
The servants stayed outside; only Mike joined Lightsong as he stepped up to the first painting.
"Did I have a wife?
His aura didn't grow stronger from Breath upon which he fed; that was another difference between a Returned and an Awakener.
The gods were a blessing.
"Please try to remember the dreams, your grace," Mike said in his polite, yet disapproving, way.
They provided visions of the future, as well as leadership and wisdom.
Our new queen arrives today."
They passed from room to room.
He didn't prompt for more information, he simply took down Lightsong's words as they came.
His hands were nearly hidden by the deep sleeves of his gold and red robe, and he carried a thick tome.
He still didn't know what had killed him, and nobody would tell him, even if they all agreed that it had been a heroic way to pass.
"If we must," Lightsong said.
It was his feastday.
Lightsong stopped before the final painting.
Servants entered, responding wordlessly to their god's needs.
"I am honored, your grace," Mike said, seating himself on a chair.
"You were there, Scoot."
"We plan to attack her?"
If he looked at it right, it looked like a sea.
His priests, however, assured him that his death had been extremely brave.
All of this, he thought as he stood, because I couldn't figure out how to die.
"Did you sleep well, your grace?"
To the side, the lesser priest disappeared with the jungle painting.
The priests hushed.
It's nothing, he thought.
Priests hustled forward to lead the girl out of the room.
The girl grew dull.
the priest asked.
Mike raised an eyebrow.
Mike opened his tome.
Mike raised an eyebrow over his bespectacled eyes.
Our lord the God King will be married."
The lesser priest scribbled down what Lightsong had said about the painting.
The Hallandren artisan's script was a specialized system of writing that wasn't based on form, but on color.
If a new queen was going to arrive today, he wanted to get a good look at her.
Lightsong moved away from the painting.
"I could make some, I'm sure.
Each bowed and retreated to the sides of the room.
She had become a Drab.
He would lack strength until he was fed.
Mike scribbled furiously-he always got excited when Lightsong remembered colors.
Mike and the servants waited.
Even if it's something useless.
They would live, seeing visions at night which would supposedly provide divinations of the future.
The servants finished tying ribbons, doing clasps, and draping silks.
The priests took her away.
He moved along to the next work of art on the wall.
It traveled along Lightsong's arm-the touch was necessary-and he drew it in.
Before I died, I mean."
Lightsong stepped forward, and the little girl glanced to the side, where a couple of priests stood in red and gold robes.
Somewhere, there was a city patron who sought a blessing from Lightsong.
And yet, the girl trembled.
Hundreds of servants and priests to saw to his needs-whether he wanted them seen to or not.
My Breath become yours."
There were some two dozen deities in the Court of Gods, and many were far more important-and far more politically savvy-than Lightsong.
There were some of these plants in the courtyards around the Court of Gods, which was why Lightsong recognized them.
"Kneeling reverently in the courtyard, your grace.
Or, at least, that was what his priests told him.
Of all the people in the world, he had the least right to be difficult.
The color of her face and eyes faded slightly, though the change was very difficult to see.
Five years ago he had died.
Perhaps the reason nobody was allowed to talk about his former life was because they didn't want anyone to know that Lightsong the Brave had actually died from a stomach cramp.
"The Court gets a bit old sometimes."
The phrase he'd given to Mike would only allow a person to control the Lifeless in non-combat situations, and it would expire one day after its first use.
"The ship had a red sail," Lightsong said.
A lesser priest rushed forward, removing it.
It was painted with a mural, of course.
One duty left, he thought.
There was nothing to fear from the Returned Gods of the Hallandren.
He slept in a room draped with silks, dyed with bright reds and yellows.
Near the eastern side of the palace, they entered a long, thin room.
The priests would interpret Lightsong's opinion of the painting, then give the person an augury-either for good or for ill-along with the exact words Lightsong had said.
And above them all reigned Susebron, the God King of Hallandren.
